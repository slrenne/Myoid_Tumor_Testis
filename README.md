# Myoid gonadal tumor, a Bayesian analysis

## Introduction

Spindle cell tumor of the testis represents an uncommon and challenging diagnosis: the differential is often troublesome due the overlapping of morphological and immunohistochemical features mostly among gonadal stromal tumors and other mesenchymal low-grade spindle cell neoplasms. An emerging distinct entity, the myoid gonadal stromal tumor, was reported in 2016 by the latest update of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of genitourinary tumors and it was defined as “spindle-shaped cells sharing features of smooth muscle and gonadal stroma”. This spindle cell neoplasm has been characterized by Weidner in an ultrastructural and immunohistochemical study, but still represents a provisional entity. Indeed, the cell of origin is debated; peritubular myoid cells and intertubular primitive mesenchymal cells have been considered.  Patients with myoid gonadal stroma tumors are asymptomatic and the neoplasm presents as a small nodule carrying a benign clinical behavior. So far, only few cases have been reported in literature, although described under different denominations. When an entity is illustrated indefinitely in many reports, it might be arduous to summarize its diagnostic features in a clear-cut manner. A way to effectively draw conclusions from diverse information is provided by the Bayesian statistics: owing to its intrinsic features, it allows to merge data deriving from a variety of sources, adjusting the sample size and the prior expected distribution.

## Aim of the work

We here intend to describe 4 cases of this rare entity and to summarize clinico-pathological characteristics through a Bayesian approach.
